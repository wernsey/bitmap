A C library for manipulating bitmap/raster graphics in memory and on disk.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "bmp.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    Bitmap *b = bm_create(128,128);

    bm_set_color(b, bm_atoi("white"));
    bm_puts(b, 30, 60, "Hello World");

    bm_save(b, "out.gif");
    bm_free(b);
    return 0;
}
```

Features:
* Supported formats:
  * Windows BMP: loads 4-, 8- and 24-bit uncompressed BMP files, saves as 24-bit.
  * GIF, PCX and TGA files can be loaded and saved without
    third-party dependencies.
  * PNG through [libpng](http://www.libpng.org)
    * support for palettized images is incomplete.
  * JPEG through [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/)
  * Alternatively, PNG and JPEG files can be loaded through the Sean Barrett's
    [stb_image][] image loader library. [stb_image][] supports a couple of
    additional formats, such as PSD, PIC and PNM binary formats. See
    `bm_load_stb()` for more information.
    A copy of `stb_image.h` has been placed in `/3rd-party/stb_image.h`.
  * Likewise, PNG and JPEG images can be saved through Sean Barrett's
    [stb_image_write][] image writer library.
    A copy of `stb_image_write.h` has been placed in `/3rd-party/stb_image_write.h`.
  * [NetPBM][] formats (PBM, PGM and PPM), in ASCII or binary variants.
* Supports manipulation of OpenGL textures, [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/)
  surfaces, [GDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Device_Interface)
  contexts. See the `bm_bind()` function. It can also serve as a back end for
  [Cairo graphics](https://cairographics.org)
* Support for SDL2's `SDL_RWops` file manipulation routines for loading images
  in the supported formats.
* Primitives: Lines, circles, elipses, bezier curves, polygons, etc.
  * Clipping rectangles are obeyed.
* Floodfill and filled primitives.
* Image resizing: nearest neighbour, bilinear and bicubic.
* Blitting, blitting with color masks, scaled and rotated blitting.
* Text rendering: [FreeType][freetype] support and built-in _8-bit_ style
  raster fonts, and support for [SFont][sfont] and [GrafX2-style][grafx2] fonts.
* Filtering with kernels and smoothing.
* [CSS-style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors) colors.
* Loading images from [XBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_BitMap) and [X
  PixMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_PixMap) data.
* Cross platform. It's been known to compile under Windows (MinGW), Linux,
  Android and Web via [Emscripten][emscripten].
* Support for Damien Guard's [ZX Origins][zx-origins] 8&times;8 pixel fonts.

The `fonts/` directory contains some 8-bit style bitmap fonts in XBM format.

## Getting Started

Copy `bmp.c` and `bmp.h` to your project directory, and add `bmp.c` to your
list of files to compile.

To enable PNG support you need [zlib][] and [libpng][] (the development
versions) installed. If you are using GCC, do the following:

* Use these flags ``-DUSEPNG `libpng-config --cflags` `` when compiling.
* Add `` `libpng-config --ldflags` -lz `` when linking.

Other compilers might have diffent flags. See the [libpng][] documentation for
your platform.

Likewise, to enable JPEG support, you need [libjpeg][] installed and specify
the `-DUSEJPG` command line option when compiling and add `-ljpeg` to your
linker options.

To use [stb_image][], put the `stb_image.h` file in the same directory as
`bmp.c` (or use your compiler's `-I` option to point it to `stb_image.h`'s
path), and add `-DUSESTB` to your compiler flags.

Similarly, to use [stb_image_write][], put the `stb_image_write.h` file in the
same directory as `bmp.c`, and add `-DUSESTBW` to your compiler flags.

Use `bm_create()` to create `Bitmap` objects and `bm_free()` to destroy them.

`bm_bind()` can be used to wrap a Bitmap object around an existing buffer of
bytes, such as OpenGL textures and SDL surfaces.

The `Makefile` generates HTML documentation from `bmp.h` through the
[d.awk][dawk] script. Type `make docs` to create the documentation.

A basic `CMakeLists.txt` file is also provided for [CMake][], but you might need
to adapt it to your specific needs. To build with CMake, use the following commands:

```
mkdir build; cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```

## Additional Utilities

* The `fonts/` directory contains some 8&times;8 bitmap fonts in XBM format
  that can be loaded via the `bm_make_xbm_font()` function.
  * Most of the fonts are based on 80's home computers, drawn from the examples
    at http://damieng.com/blog/2011/02/20/typography-in-8-bits-system-fonts
  * The `INSTRUCTIONS` file contains information for using them.
  * The `tomthumb.c` file contains a 4&times;6 font based on the "Tom Thumb"
    monospace font at http://robey.lag.net/2010/01/23/tiny-monospace-font.html
* The `ftypefont/` directory contains a wrapper for
  [FreeType](http://www.freetype.org/) to allow rendering of freetype-supported
  fonts on `Bitmap` structures.
* The `misc/` directory contains
  * `gif.c` and `gif.h` - code for programmatically manipulating animated GIFs.
    It originates from the file I used to develop the GIF encoder/decoder
    originally.
  * `cairoback.c` - A demo of how the bitmap objects can be used as a back-end
    for the [Cairo graphics library](https://cairographics.org)
  * The `palette/` subdirectory contains a utility for generating palettes and
    converting images to those palettes.
  * `xpm.c`: Samples on how to use the module with the XPM file
    format. `to_xbm.c` contains a function that can output a bitmap as a XBM.
  * The `kmeans.c` contains a program that uses
    [K-means clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering) to
    identify the dominant colors in an image.
  * `imgdup.c` is a program that scans directories for duplicate images using
    the _dHash_ algorithm.
  * `nanosvg.c` is an example of how to use the library with Mikko Mononen's [NanoSVG][]
    library to load SVG files.
  * `bm_microui.c` contains functions to render `rxi`'s [microui][] graphical
    user interfaces to a `Bitmap` structure.
  * `cp437.c` and `cp437.h` contains a [Code page 437][cp437] `BmFont` and
    some utility functions to draw a grid-based [TUI][] screen.
  * `bdffont.c` contains code to load and draw [BDF][] fonts as `BmFont` objects.
  * `bgichr.h` is a set of functions that can handle old Borland [BGI][bgi] fonts
    (usually files with a `.CHR` extension) as `BmFont` objects.

## TODO

* Support for [PCF][] fonts (now that I support BDF fonts).
  * See also <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Compiled_Format>
  * <https://web.archive.org/web/20010215151331if_/http://myhome.hananet.net/~bumchul/xfont/pcf.txt>
  * You'll find some font examples at <https://github.com/Tecate/bitmap-fonts>
* If I'm going to have `bm_rotate_cw()` and `bm_rotate_ccw()` functions, then I ought to have
  flip horizontal and vertical functions as well for completeness.
* Since `bm_rotate_cw()` and `bm_rotate_ccw()` functions take the clipping rect into account,
  I should consider doing the same for some of the other API functions for consistency, like
  `bm_resample()` and co. Also the flip functions suggested above.
* Support for [QOI][] files. I was going to just pull in the [reference implementation][qui.h], but
  the `qoi_decode()` function didn't look like it'd fit in nicely with the `BmReader` interface.
